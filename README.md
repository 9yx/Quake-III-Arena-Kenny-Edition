Welcome to the Quake 3 source code!
===============================

Quake 3 is one of my favourite games. This repository is created in order to allow me to enjoy both this game and its source code in a world of chaning standards. I do not modify gameplay code or do the changes that are invariant to gameplay.

The general direction is towards simplification rather than complexity, so the codebase should be easy to build, executable does not require additional shared libraries to work, no crazy oop or multi-layered abstractions in the code (until I need this, since there is no absolute rules). Only windows platform is supported.

The screeenshot below has no relation to this codebase - just a random screenshot from my early programming experiments. Still it is here to stay.
