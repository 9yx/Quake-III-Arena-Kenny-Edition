Welcome to the Quake 3 source code!
===============================

Quake 3 is one of my favourite games. This repository contains updated version of the original Q3 codebase with reorganized code structure, compatibility fixes, build setup for the latest Visual Studio and my own modifications that update the core tech but preserve original gameplay, look and feel.

The general direction is to simplify the things. The codebase should be easy to build, executable does not require additional shared libraries to work, no crazy no-op OOP or multi-layered abstractions in the code (until I need this, since there are no absolute rules). Only windows platform is supported.

The screeenshot below has no relation to this codebase, I just like it.
